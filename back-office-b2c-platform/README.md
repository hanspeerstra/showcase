# Back office B2C platform

It's an existing Laravel project and slimmed down to only keep code that's interesting. It offers a condensed glimpse into the larger project, with some dependencies omitted from the codebase.

The primary aim of this project is to showcase an approach to structuring a larger project.

Initially, the project followed the conventional structure provided by Laravel. However, as the project expanded over time, it became clear that this structure was no longer adequate. Consequently, a decision was made to integrate the HTTP layer directly into the domain itself, resulting in a more modular and compartmentalized architecture.
