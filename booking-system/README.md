# Booking system

This is a fresh Laravel project that has been streamlined to retain only the most relevant code components.

Within this project, you can explore front-end components (HTTP and console) located in the app directory, while the core domain logic is housed in the src directory.

Following Laravel best practices, the front-end components are organized within the resources directory, and they have been intentionally emptied to illustrate the frontend code structure.
